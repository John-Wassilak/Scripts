# Scripts
Personal scripts that I use daily.

I nuked my home folder the other day and it's been painful to recover...

Turning over a new leaf and automating everything + triple backing up.

## Usage
- I typically clone to ~/scripts and add to path.
- If I want .desktop entries for easy execution I'll run the included `install.sh`

## Streams
Some of the things in here are multi-media related. I have a directory of .strm files
which play on thinks like kodi. Then there are some wrapper scripts for when I do so
on my laptop

## Notes

- [firewall.sh](firewall.sh) : basic stateful firewall
- [mount-crypt.sh](mount-crypt.sh) : decrypt/mount encrypted partition
- [play-cams.sh](play-cams.sh) : logs into my reolink nvr and plays all feeds via mpv
- [play-streams.sh](play-streams.sh) : wrapper script for .strm files. I tend to use this for videos mainly designed for in-browser playing. But I like using mpv...
- [gentoo-cleanup-files.sh](gentoo-cleanup-files.sh) : clean gentoo cache
- [gentoo-update.sh](gentoo-update.sh) : gentoo update commands
