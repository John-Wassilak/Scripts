# Scripts
Personal scripts that I use daily.

I nuked my home folder the other day and it's been painful to recover...

Turning over a new leaf and automating everything + triple backing up.

## Usage
- I typically clone to ~/scripts and add to path.
- If I want .desktop entries for easy execution I'll run the included `install.sh`

## Streams
Some of the things in here are multi-media related. I have a directory of .strm files
which play on thinks like kodi. Then there are some wrapper scripts for when I do so
on my laptop
